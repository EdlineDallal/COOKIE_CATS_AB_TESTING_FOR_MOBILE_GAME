# Mobile Games A/B Testing- Cookie Cats
## Introduction
This project is based on a mini project from Datacamp and aims to analyze an A/B test conducted on the mobile puzzle game, Cookie Cats, developed by Tactile Entertainment. The goal of the A/B test was to determine the impact of moving the first gate in Cookie Cats from level 30 to level 40 on player retention.

## Background
Cookie Cats is a "connect three"-style puzzle game where the player must connect tiles of the same color to clear the board and win the level. The game features singing cats and, as players progress through the levels, they encounter gates that force them to wait or make an in-app purchase to progress. These gates serve to give players an enforced break from playing the game, hopefully resulting in the player's enjoyment of the game being increased and prolonged.

## A/B Test
Initially, the first gate was placed at level 30. In this project, we analyze the impact of moving the first gate in Cookie Cats from level 30 to level 40 on player retention. The dataset used in this project contains data from 90,189 players who played Cookie Cats during the A/B test.

## Results
The analysis showed that there was strong evidence that 7-day retention was higher when the gate was at level 30 than when it was at level 40. Therefore, the conclusion is that if we want to keep retention high - both 1-day and 7-day retention - we should not move the gate from level 30 to level 40.

## Conclusion
Retention is one of the most important metrics for any game, as it ensures the player base remains engaged with the game. The bootstrap result tells us that there is strong evidence that 7-day retention is higher when the gate is at level 30 than when it is at level 40. The theory of hedonic adaptation can give one explanation for this result. By forcing players to take a break when they reach a gate, their enjoyment of the game is prolonged. But when the gate is moved to level 40, fewer players make it far enough, and they are more likely to quit the game because they simply got bored of it. This project highlights the importance of analyzing player retention and considering the impact of game design choices on player engagement.
